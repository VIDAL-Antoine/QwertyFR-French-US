# French (US) Extended - Keyboard layout based on the Linux layout of the same name

The Ubuntu OS (so I guess other Linux distros) offers a keyboard layout for French people that the accented letters to a QWERTY layout.

So I decided to create an equivalent for the Windows OS with some more characters mainly for the Alt and Shift + Alt combinations.


## Key overview

The non Alt keys are like the standard QWERTY layout (which can be seen in the image above). The next images show the keys binded to the Alt key and then the Shift + Alt keys. The idea was just to add mathematical signs and greek letters when the key combination didn't type anything.

## How to install

### Winfows

To install it on Windows just get the .zip and start setup.exe.

### Linux 

Since the layout is already available on an Ubuntu when installing that distro there isn't a version for it.

### Mac

Since I don't own a Mac I can't provide a version for this layout.
