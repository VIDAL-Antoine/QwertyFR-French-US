# French (US) - Keyboard layout based on the Linux layout of the same name

The Ubuntu OS (so I guess other Linux distros) offers a keyboard layout for French people that the accented letters to a QWERTY layout.

So I decided to create an equivalent for the Windows OS with some more characters mainly for the Alt and Shift + Alt combinations.


## Overview

The next images show the keys binded to the Alt key and then the Shift + Alt keys.

## How to install

Currently it is only for Windows since the layout is already available on an Ubuntu when installing a that distro.
To install it on Windows just get the .zip and start setup.exe.
